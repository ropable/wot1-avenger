        "description": "The dawn rays of the sun greet you as you begin your preparations for the time of trial. Today you will become the youngest ever to challenge for the title of Grandmaster of the Five Winds. When your foster father, Naijishi, was murdered by Yaemon, the second Grandmaster stepped into his place. Now, many seasons later another of the Grandmasters has died and the position is open once more for there must always be five who lead the order. You have been invited to challenge for it because of your consummate mastery of the Way of the Tiger.\n\nAt the appointed hour you walk, alone, across the sands to the Temple of the Rock. It is a huge pillared hall built into the side of an enormous boulder of red granite brought to rest on the Island of Tranquil Dreams by the ice floes of the age of snow, which carved out the Great Valley Reaches of the far north. As you approach the Temple, you see that the monks and a large number of villagers have assembled to watch the combat between you and the other challenger, Gorobei.\n\nLike you, Gorobei is an Initiate of the Inner Circle, a devout worshipper of Kwon and a capable fighter. He is older, heavier and stronger than you and has been unsuccessful in one previous challenge, but he is a skillful wrestler. You walk into the Temple and bow to the Grandmaster of the Dawn, a man who looks younger than his fifty years, slim and taut with piercing dark eyes. Beside you, Gorobei also bows, his face a mask showing no emotion. He is clad only in a loin cloth and his rippling muscles gleam with an oil that will make it difficult to keep a grip on him. You must defeat him in unarmed combat in order to be allowed to undertake the spiritual test which will show whether you are ready to become a Grandmaster.\n\nGorobei turns to you and bows and you return the courtesy. The Grandmaster of the Dawn reminds you that this is not a fight to the death and you may not use Inner Force. He signals for you to begin. Gorobei advances warily across the polished granite floor, his big hands ready to grapple you.",

Intrigued, you ask them why they are taking you there instead of to their own temple at Mortavalon.\n\n'Because Manse the Deathmage, a servant of Nemesis and the most powerful sorcerer of them all, is journeying north to meet Honoric and Yaemon, he of the order of the Scarlet Mantis, to work a great magic which will plunge the world into darkness and bring nearer the day when we, the followers of Nemesis, will rule everything on Orb.'\n\n'Yaemon will betray him,' you say.\n\nThey laugh and reply that the Deathmage knows the thoughts of all men and can see them plotting from afar. With that they leave you, preparing themselves for sleep. For some hours you wrestle with your bonds, loosening them until you can hook your thumbs inside the chafing ropes. At last you are free and you decide to creep into the cave, lest they use spells to snare you once again.",

        "description": "By midday of the next day, the Aquamarin has left the islands behind and ahead of you looms the Greater Continent. You turn north and hug the rocky coast for some days; you regain much lost Endurance as you rest, gliding over the still calm seas. It begins to rain slightly on the next day, as you follow the shore of a vast bay. Glaivas comes to talk to you and points to a large estuary where the Greybones empties into the sea. He tells you that his home city, Tor, lies up river. You ask him whether there is a temple to Kwon there and he shakes his head but freely tells you that his goddess is the Allmother, Preserver of Life. You ask him of the cities which lie beyond Tor on the Greybones river but a look of pain crosses his face.\n\n'Let me tell you, instead, of Doomover, for that is our port of call,' he says. 'It is one of the largest cities in the Manmarch, perhaps four hundred thousand souls, and it is ruled by the Legion of the Sword of Doom. Most spit when they hear the name but they are one of the best armies on Orb. They worship the Wargod, Vasch-Ro, He who sows for the Reaper, and they spread fear about them in battle. There are temples to other gods but the Cathedral to the Wargod overshadows them all. The Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom is Honoric, a blackheart who has never been defeated in combat. It is said that he once slew a storm giant, single handed. He is without doubt a peerless swordsman. The order of the Scarlet Mantis has a temple there, too. They send their acolytes to the Far Snows for training, where they become used to hardship of all kinds. Yaemon is the greatest warrior they have ever had to lead them. They use the cross of Avatar, the Supreme Principle of Good as a symbol, but with a serpent twining round it. In this way you may know one if you see one.'\n\nOn the next day, you sight the fortified harbour walls of Doomover and two long blackwood ships dart out to meet you. They fly the flag of the Barbican, the Doomover navy. As they approach, a tall man in black ringed mail orders you to heave to. The captain obeys and the sails are slackened. He answers various questions but when the naval commander asks what business he has at Doomover, he looks nervously at Glaivas, licking his lips. Glaivas answers for him, saying that he has come to sell galley slaves.\n\nThe commander grins, 'I was going to confiscate your ship but as you bring men we have need of, you may pass through the Barbican.' With that, you are allowed on your way.\n\nThe Barbican itself is a huge gatehouse, like a fort, which spans the ends of the harbour walls in an arc. The ship glides beneath it and is tied up at the busy wharf. You thank Glaivas for his help and jump lithely to the land. He is returning to Tor to organise the defence against the forces of Vile should your mission fail. He throws you a pouch containing ten gold pieces, saying, 'Here, you need this. May Fate smile on you, Ninja.' You pocket the pouch and turn to the city.\n\nTwo gates stand side by side. The larger is a huge arch of black obsidian like a rainbow of dark glass. The other, much smaller, consists of two pairs of white marble pillars topped by a portico on which the words 'Portal of the Gods' are written in gold leaf.",

The larger is dressed in black plate mail and carries a black shield upon which is emblazoned a silver sword hanging from a silver thread, the Sword of Doom. His face is arrogant and cruel. The other is dressed in the clothes of a martial monk, scarlet with a thin black belt. They are riding towards you in silence and the monk's piercing black eyes gaze unwavering, into yours.\n\nThe Seer informs you that the vision shows Yaemon Grandmaster of Flame, riding with Honoric, Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, north from Mortavalon. He tells you that they are travelling to the Pillars of Change, each to speak a word which will imprison a god and a goddess in Inferno. Honoric seeks to rule the whole of the Manmarch. You fall into a trance and when you wake up you find yourself outside Doomover, walking on the road to Mortavalon.\n\nYou wonder what the Seer may have done whilst you were entranced.

You reassure him that you are not a cannibal and ask him what happened. He tells you that he is a monk from Fiendil. He is losing track of time but he thinks that he has felt the sun on his face four times since a man called Hononc had him blinded for spying through a keyhole.\n\n'He was with a Grandmaster of our order, a fine man named Yaemon and I saw them planning a journey north on a map, but Yaemon heard me and I was caught.

You stop to watch at a distance as Honoric, a powerfully built man with an arrogant and cruel look about him, borrows the Captain’s weapon and invites the soldiers to attack him.\n\nSeveral do so at once but there is no way past his flashing sword. He disarms three of them, then beats the rest back - all they can do is fend off his blows and you know that he could kill them at will. Seeing this display, Manse grimaces sourly and, pointing, turns the sword which Honoric is holding into a tulip.\n\nThe Captain of the Guard cannot resist chuckling at the sight of this huge man, the Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, clutching a tulip with which to belabour the soldiers. Honoric turns red with rage and, flinging the flower down, he draws his own great black sword. A chill of horror grips you and the guards cower as a pall of fear descends upon the castle. The wicked blade smokes slightly and the tulip has turned back into a sword.\n\n‘Where is your magic now, Deathmage? Your spells will not work with Sorcerak unsheathed,’ says Honoric. The Deathmage’s eyes narrow and his pallid pinched face seems to whiten still further as he mouths another spell. Nothing happpens and Honoric turns on his heel and walks towards the Keep, sheathing Sorcerak as he goes.\n\nAs he opens the gate which leads to the Inner Bailey you catch sight of a tower at the back of the castle which seems part derelict. It would make an easy climb. The Bailiff tells you that they have hired ‘a real Bard’ for tomorrow but when he has heard you sing and seen you juggle, he says that you can do a turn at dinner that evening.",

In the darkness of the oar deck you are thankful for the diet which has given you unusual powers of seeing in the dark.

One by one you free the crew and tell them to wait quietly for your signal, whilst you go to the main cabin to see if the buccaneer Captain is sleeping aboard his prize.

It is only through failing a mission that a true Ninja would be captured and there is always time to bite off one's tongue from one's head and bleed to death rather than risk betraying secrets under torture.'\n\nHe continues, 'We have never seen one who shows such promise nor one who has mastered so ably the Way of the Tiger.

        "description": "After the ceremony you all file out of the temple onto the golden sands and there is a frugal feast of rice and fruits shared by the villagers and the monks. You eat sparingly and take your leave early, wishing to meditate before you sleep. Relaxed from the meditation which frees your spirit from the shackles of your aching body your eyes close as soon as you lay yourself down on the straw-filled sacking that is your bed. You drift into a deep but troubled sleep.\n\nYou see a sleek-oared ship setting sail from the Land of Plenty. A tall, resolute-looking man is on the high stern castle, his legs braced against the swell. He wears a thick cloak of dark green against the weather and the sun flashes so vividly on the buckle of his sword belt that you believe this is not a dream but a vision. A sailor calls him by name, 'Glaivas', and he turns to look at you but then the vision fades and the brilliant blue sky is replaced by sombre purple clouds against which a large and dark castle looms. Three turrets on a great black Keep seem to pierce the douds. You are walking towards it, bent on completing a difficult and important mission.\n\nWhen ou awake you remember the dreams as if they were pictures painted on the wall of your monastic cell, but your sleep has at least restored any Endurance you lost in your contest with Gorobei. You are walking towards the Temple when there is a commotion on the beach and two fishermen run up to you with the news that a ship is riding at anchor offshore. A man rows himself to the beach and steps out, as the Grandmasters walk to the strand to greet him. He introduces himself as Glaivas and, bowing respectfully, he asks to talk to the Grandmaster of Grandmasters.\n\n'You may address us all,' says the Grandmaster of the Dawn, 'for we have no secrets on the Island of Tranquil Dreams.'\n\n'Not since you lost the Scrolls of Kettsuin,' Glaivas returns darkly.\n\n'What do you know of the Scrolls of Kettsuin?', asks the Grandmaster. The monks wait tensely as Glaivas looks around carefully before replying.\n\n'The Scrolls of Kettsuin hold the secret to the Word of Power which will bind Kwon himself in Inferno if it is spoken at the Pillars of Change in the great snow-wastes of the north. Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, of the order of the Scarlet Mantis stole it from you many years ago and he has deciphered the Word. It is the month of All-Mother Splendour and for three days the moon will turn red during the Great Conjunction of the Planets - something that occurs only once every five hundred years. If the Word is spoken by the Pillars of Change at this time your God, Kwon, will be imprisoned in the bottomless pit of fire, leaving the monks who worship Vile free to spread their dominion over the lands of men.'\n\nAt the mention of Yaemon's name there is uproar but as Glaivas continues an unnatural quiet descends.\n\n'Yaemon is preparing to set out even now from the city of Doomover on the long journey to the Ice Wastes. Though a Ranger long used to patrolling the wilderness on the edge of the Rift, I am no match for such as he. Is there one among you who will try to stop him?'\n\nAs Glaivas spoke you felt the burning need to be revenged on Yaemon flare within your breast. Your dream of Glaivas, for it was he you saw astride the deck of the ship which now rides at anchor near the sands, has convinced you that you are destined for this quest and you step forward saying, 'I  shall stop him.'\n\n'You are young,' says Glaivas, 'Can you succeed where I, a Ranger Lord, would fail?'\n\n'I am Ninja,' you reply.\n\nGlaivas starts. The Grandmaster of the Dawn sighs and says, 'Yes, I rename you Avenger, for if anyone can succeed, and you must for the sake of all mankind, it will be you.' With that he turns towards the Temple, and prayer.\n\nThe city of Doomover lies on the western coast of the Manmarch and Glaivas gifts you a map which shows the many cities and strange lands which stretch north to the snow wastes. You spend the rest of the day preparing, lacing the iron sleeves to your dark hued costume and gathering together the tools of the Ninja, before spending some hours in quiet meditation. You board Glaivas' ship in time to sail on the evening tide. You must find Yaemon and kill him before he reaches the Pillars of Change or all will be lost.",

A priest in yellow robes comes out to help him but, as he leans down, a mounted knight in a black surcoat rides up the temple steps and lops the priest's head off. Another priest casts a spell, the horse rears backwards and then two other horsemen wearing the same coat of arms, a silver sword hanging by a silver thread on a black background, ride up and take the reins from their friend. He curses the young warrior in a rage but seems helpless as they lead him past you and gallop out through the marble gate. Priests carry their decapitated colleague and the young warrior, who has left a trail of blood on the steps, into the temple.\n\nAs they do so a wizened, stooped old man with a necklace of crystal which clicks as he sways, croaks, 'I foretold it but did you heed me, the Seer? No! Will Béatan the Free smile on you now, false priests?'\n\nHe turns and shuffles towards a small wooden chapel. The dead priest served Béaten, whose followers seek to bring nearer paradise on Orb by living lives of capricious goodness mocking all laws that constrict the free spirit.",

To save time you decide to swim across the narrow eastern point of the star-shaped sea and the chill water is invigorating. At last you enter the narrow cobbled streets of the city of Druath Glennan. The houses are tall and thin, built of dark brick save for the wooden balconies which almost touch above, making the streets dark and gloomy.\n\nYou are glad to have disguised yourself as a fisherman since the guards are unmistakedly in the pay of the monks who worship Vile. Their red-shuttered monastery runs along one side of the Square of the Gods, faced by a temple to the All-Mother. You notice a poor house in one of the dingy side streets and, changing into the guise of a beggar, you fall in with the drunkards who are supported there by the priestesses of the All-Mother. You are planning to reconnoitre the monastery to Vile, hoping that Yaemon is within, when you overhear one of the beggars telling the story of how he lost his arm.\n\nThere is a grimy and bloody bandage hanging loosely from his shoulder. It seems he was once a sweeper in the monastery, but was thrown out because of his drinking. Hearing through the grapevine that Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, was visiting the monastery, he foolishly decided to throw himself before the arch monk and beg for his job again. Yaemon, surprisingly, received him but sneeringly told him that even the gutter was too good a place for him.\n\nHe had a friend with him, 'A wicked looking man, with a wicked heart. He had the most hideous, soulless red eyes....Manse the Deathmage, they called him. Anyway, just for sport he said he would punish me, and before I know it my arm drops off. I would have bled to death if it hadn't been for the priestesses.'\n\nHe gets little sympathy; one of them, his voice slurred by drink, asks him what he expects if he mixes with Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, and the Deathmage, the most powerful sorcerer on Orb. You gather from their conversation that Yaemon had been waiting with Honoric, leader of the Legion of the Sword of Doom, for Manse the Deathmage to join them in Druath Glennan. Now they have set out for a castle called Quench-heart Keep, near the Goblins Teeth Mountains. As it is now late, you decide to stay in the poor-house and set off in the morning.\n\nYou are awakened in the night by the smell of acrid smoke. The room in which you are sleeping is on fire and a sheet of flame blocks the doorway and fills the hallway beyond. There are no windows through which to escape. The room is filling with smoke.

The sea is so calm that after two weeks without the tang of salt spray on your lips you forget that it is composed of water at all. The oarsmen row for ten hours a day but they are free men, not chained to their oars. Two bear the scars of a pirate's persuader; captured by buccaneers, they are of the lucky few who have lived to see the sky again. All of them have the heavy upper body of the oarsman, some who turned to the sea for their livelihood too young are squat and mis-shapen, moulded by life at the oar into grotesque travesties of the mountain dwarves.\n\nThe Land of Plenty passes to the south and you are in sight of the Isle of the Magical Goddess when the lookout cries a warning. The helmsman steers a new course and the drum-beat quickens as the oarsmen redouble their efforts. The ship that is approaching is long and low, painted green and red and flying a red pennant at the top of its mast. Glaivas, standing next to you at the rail, says, 'That ship is from Port o' Reavers, we’ll never outrun it.' So saying, he draws his sword.\n\nThe oarsmen strain, sweating with effort but they cannot match the pace of the slaves on the Reavers' ship, galvanized into a frenzied spurt by the barbed whips of their overseers. At last the Captain gives the order 'Prepare to repel boarders', and you ready yourself for combat. The pirate ship carries a spiked ram but they are obviously trying to take the Aquamarin as a prize for they grapple and come alongside. The Reavers carry scimitars and chain nets and are led in their rush to attack by a nine-foot monster whose body is covered in knobbles of mis-grown bone, an Ogre with a large spiked hammer. The Aquamarin's crew look no match for the battle-scarred buccaneers.",

Staring out from beneath the surface, you see the Torturer turn in pain and then threaten the boy with the red hot iron and the boy points to the water. The enraged Torturer turns his hooded face towards the water and, seizing his axe, runs screaming to the pool.\n\nYou erupt from the water and unleash another Shuriken, which takes him in the arm before he hits the surface. As he gasps in pain, you use the Tiger’s Paw to knock the axe from his grasp and wrestle with him as you sink into the black depths. He is strong but no match for you underwater. You have trained for this and use repeated Cobra Strikes to pummel him into helplessness, the water barely lessening the speed of your blows.\n\nThe Torturer floats lifeless to the surface and you drag yourself, gasping, into the torture chamber. There are several prisoners and they implore you to release them. Seizing the opportunity to create a diversion, you do so, asking only that they wait to the count of two hundred before following you out of the chamber.",

        "description": "Togawa nods again and asks a third question, 'What are your eyes?'\n\n'My eyes are the Sun and the Moon,' you say, reciting the words from the secret Litany of the Ninja Grandmasters. 'I am Ninja, I follow the Way of the Tiger.'\n\nTogawa beams at you, 'A Grandmaster of the Five Winds,' he says, 'I must do my best to help you.'\n\nYou sleep on the cold floor of the cave, but in your dreams, Togawa, his body silver and ethereal, appears to you stretching out his hand. You take it and he lifts you out of your body, Looking down, you can see yourself, asleep, in the candlelight. Soon, you are far from the cave, washed by ethereal wind. You hold on tight, knowing that without Togawa's guidance, you would drift helplessly; the skills of the Ninja cannot aid you here. The monk points ahead to a gleaming archway beyond which a silver pathway stretches up into the clouds. Cherubs flock around its pillars and a Guardian Angel, flawless and white, stands between them.\n\n'This is the Gateway to the Seven Heavens,' says Togawa. 'We may not enter yet.' As he speaks, a sinuous form takes shape on the silver road. It glides past the Guardian Angel and as it approaches you see that it is a perfect tiger, but its fur is white and its eyes are blue.\n\n'The Spirit Tiger is a servant of Kwon,' says Togawa. 'She will help us.' As the tigress looks at you, she passes on a part of her knowledge. She has stalked Yaemon on the Ethereal Plane, undetected even by him. Yaemon and Honoric, Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom who worships the god, Vasch-Ro, are journeying to the far-away city of Druath Glennan at the edge of the Far Snows. They will meet a third there, Manse the Deathmage, a potent and evil sorcerer who reverences Nemesis, the Supreme Principle of Evil.\n\nTogether they plan to journey to the Pillars of Change and each knows a secret word which will bind a god or goddess in Inferno. You realise that you must journey to Druath Glennan as quickly as possible. The Spirit Tiger blesses you and Fate will smile on you. You try to speak to the Spirit Tiger but words will not come and Togawa pulls you away from the Gateway to the Seven Heavens.\n\nWhen you awake in the morning he says, 'The unholy alliance must be stopped. Of all the evil gods, only the followers of Vile, Vasch-Ro and Nemesis would have the discipline to join together. Nemesis is the greatest of the evil gods. Never before have three such powerful and evil men trusted each other.' He pulls a bag of herbs from a crack in the rock. 'These have healing virtue,' he says. You take them and may use them at any time to restore up to 8 Endurance.\n\nYou thank him and are about to ask him if he will accompany you, when he lies down on the cave floor and falls asleep. Sensing that there is no further help to be gained, you begin the climb down Mount Gwalodrun to the pass below. A day later, you enter the foothills of Fortune Pass.",

The soldiers have brought their weapons into the tavern but many have loosened or discarded parts of their armour in the sweltering heat. The reek of stale sweat is overpowering. A man who must weigh twenty stones or more ambles up and down the long bar, slamming mugs of mead on the counter and pocketing silver.\n\nYou buy a mugful and listen to the conversations. They are shouting from table to table about the campaign they are going to fight against the people of the Spires of Foreshadowing. At one table a man of twenty-five or so is particularly loud. He demands mead and two of the soldiers with him grab his mug, fighting for the privilege of buying his drink. He ignores this and, spotting you, challenges you to a drinking bout.",

You slip into the water and dive down into the chill depths and find that your head hits rock above you before you have surfaced.\n\nYou swim powerfully along the underwater tunnel for a minute before light shimmering above lets you know that you can surface at Last. As you do so, a man’s screaming fills your ears. A young boy chained to the wall goggles wide-eyed at you, but says nothing. You have surfaced in the torture chamber of Quench-heart Keep.\n\nA ducking stool hangs above you and the insomniac Torturer is still at work, applying a red-hot iron to the flesh of a man who hangs by chains from the roof. The Torturer has a large axe in his belt and his broad, heavily-muscled back runs with sweat in the heat of a brazier filled with glowing coals. He wears heavy spiked bracelets of leather and the black hood of an executioner.",

She is bartering a price for a spell which they wish her to cast in the 'Hall of Webs'. She is pointing out that if this is their only defence against spies in the corridor which joins the refectory to the sleeping quarters then the Webs of Nullaq spell is worth more than three hundred golds.\n\nYou pick up your hood with its meagre haul of copper coins and pad slowly away before lying low until darkness falls.

After several days you turn north east and warily cross the track which leads north from Mortavalon to the city of Sundial and climb into the wild and windswept hills known as the Barrow Swales, heading for the dty of Fiendil.\n\nOn a day which dawns strangely cold, a mist lies heavily around the hills and you find yourself in a narrow gully. A boulder thuds dully towards you from higher up the, hill but you leap agilely out of its way, to be faced by a great Two-headed Giant waving a thorny club, which looks like the trunk of a small tree. The club whistles through the air towards you and you duck low beneath it. The Giant roars in frustration.",

You are able to balance on one arm whilst with the other you delicately test the floor ahead for strands of web.\n\nIt takes you half an hour to slowly cross the room but you manage it without breaking any of the strands. You reach the door and, neatly flipping onto your feet, open it soundlessly. You are on the balcony above the refectory and the dining hail.

        "description": "The dawn rays of the sun greet you as you begin your preparations for the time of trial. Today you will become the youngest ever to challenge for the title of Grandmaster of the Five Winds. When your foster father, Naijishi, was murdered by Yaemon, the second Grandmaster stepped into his place. Now, many seasons later another of the Grandmasters has died and the position is open once more for there must always be five who lead the order. You have been invited to challenge for it because of your consummate mastery of the Way of the Tiger.\n\nAt the appointed hour you walk, alone, across the sands to the Temple of the Rock. It is a huge pillared hall built into the side of an enormous boulder of red granite brought to rest on the Island of Tranquil Dreams by the ice floes of the age of snow, which carved out the Great Valley Reaches of the far north. As you approach the Temple, you see that the monks and a large number of villagers have assembled to watch the combat between you and the other challenger, Gorobei.\n\nLike you, Gorobei is an Initiate of the Inner Circle, a devout worshipper of Kwon and a capable fighter. He is older, heavier and stronger than you and has been unsuccessful in one previous challenge, but he is a skillful wrestler. You walk into the Temple and bow to the Grandmaster of the Dawn, a man who looks younger than his fifty years, slim and taut with piercing dark eyes. Beside you, Gorobei also bows, his face a mask showing no emotion. He is clad only in a loin cloth and his rippling muscles gleam with an oil that will make it difficult to keep a grip on him. You must defeat him in unarmed combat in order to be allowed to undertake the spiritual test which will show whether you are ready to become a Grandmaster.\n\nGorobei turns to you and bows and you return the courtesy. The Grandmaster of the Dawn reminds you that this is not a fight to the death and you may not use Inner Force. He signals for you to begin. Gorobei advances warily across the polished granite floor, his big hands ready to grapple you.",

        "description": "By midday of the next day, the Aquamarin has left the islands behind and ahead of you looms the Greater Continent. You turn north and hug the rocky coast for some days; you regain much lost Endurance as you rest, gliding over the still calm seas. It begins to rain slightly on the next day, as you follow the shore of a vast bay. Glaivas comes to talk to you and points to a large estuary where the Greybones empties into the sea. He tells you that his home city, Tor, lies up river. You ask him whether there is a temple to Kwon there and he shakes his head but freely tells you that his goddess is the Allmother, Preserver of Life. You ask him of the cities which lie beyond Tor on the Greybones river but a look of pain crosses his face.\n\n'Let me tell you, instead, of Doomover, for that is our port of call,' he says. 'It is one of the largest cities in the Manmarch, perhaps four hundred thousand souls, and it is ruled by the Legion of the Sword of Doom. Most spit when they hear the name but they are one of the best armies on Orb. They worship the Wargod, Vasch-Ro, He who sows for the Reaper, and they spread fear about them in battle. There are temples to other gods but the Cathedral to the Wargod overshadows them all. The Marshal of the Legion of the Sword of Doom is Honoric, a blackheart who has never been defeated in combat. It is said that he once slew a storm giant, single handed. He is without doubt a peerless swordsman. The order of the Scarlet Mantis has a temple there, too. They send their acolytes to the Far Snows for training, where they become used to hardship of all kinds. Yaemon is the greatest warrior they have ever had to lead them. They use the cross of Avatar, the Supreme Principle of Good as a symbol, but with a serpent twining round it. In this way you may know one if you see one.'\n\nOn the next day, you sight the fortified harbour walls of Doomover and two long blackwood ships dart out to meet you. They fly the flag of the Barbican, the Doomover navy. As they approach, a tall man in black ringed mail orders you to heave to. The captain obeys and the sails are slackened. He answers various questions but when the naval commander asks what business he has at Doomover, he looks nervously at Glaivas, licking his lips. Glaivas answers for him, saying that he has come to sell galley slaves.\n\nThe commander grins, 'I was going to confiscate your ship but as you bring men we have need of, you may pass through the Barbican.' With that, you are allowed on your way.\n\nThe Barbican itself is a huge gatehouse, like a fort, which spans the ends of the harbour walls in an arc. The ship glides beneath it and is tied up at the busy wharf. You thank Glaivas for his help and jump lithely to the land. He is returning to Tor to organise the defence against the forces of Vile should your mission fail. He throws you a pouch containing ten gold pieces, saying, 'Here, you need this. May Fate smile on you, Ninja.' You pocket the pouch and turn to the city.\n\nTwo gates stand side by side. The larger is a huge arch of black obsidian like a rainbow of dark glass. The other, much smaller, consists of two pairs of white marble pillars topped by a portico on which the words 'Portal of the Gods' are written in gold leaf.",

        "description": "After the ceremony you all file out of the temple onto the golden sands and there is a frugal feast of rice and fruits shared by the villagers and the monks. You eat sparingly and take your leave early, wishing to meditate before you sleep. Relaxed from the meditation which frees your spirit from the shackles of your aching body your eyes close as soon as you lay yourself down on the straw-filled sacking that is your bed. You drift into a deep but troubled sleep.\n\nYou see a sleek-oared ship setting sail from the Land of Plenty. A tall, resolute-looking man is on the high stern castle, his legs braced against the swell. He wears a thick cloak of dark green against the weather and the sun flashes so vividly on the buckle of his sword belt that you believe this is not a dream but a vision. A sailor calls him by name, 'Glaivas', and he turns to look at you but then the vision fades and the brilliant blue sky is replaced by sombre purple clouds against which a large and dark castle looms. Three turrets on a great black Keep seem to pierce the douds. You are walking towards it, bent on completing a difficult and important mission.\n\nWhen ou awake you remember the dreams as if they were pictures painted on the wall of your monastic cell, but your sleep has at least restored any Endurance you lost in your contest with Gorobei. You are walking towards the Temple when there is a commotion on the beach and two fishermen run up to you with the news that a ship is riding at anchor offshore. A man rows himself to the beach and steps out, as the Grandmasters walk to the strand to greet him. He introduces himself as Glaivas and, bowing respectfully, he asks to talk to the Grandmaster of Grandmasters.\n\n'You may address us all,' says the Grandmaster of the Dawn, 'for we have no secrets on the Island of Tranquil Dreams.'\n\n'Not since you lost the Scrolls of Kettsuin,' Glaivas returns darkly.\n\n'What do you know of the Scrolls of Kettsuin?', asks the Grandmaster. The monks wait tensely as Glaivas looks around carefully before replying.\n\n'The Scrolls of Kettsuin hold the secret to the Word of Power which will bind Kwon himself in Inferno if it is spoken at the Pillars of Change in the great snow-wastes of the north. Yaemon, Grandmaster of Flame, of the order of the Scarlet Mantis stole it from you many years ago and he has deciphered the Word. It is the month of All-Mother Splendour and for three days the moon will turn red during the Great Conjunction of the Planets - something that occurs only once every five hundred years. If the Word is spoken by the Pillars of Change at this time your God, Kwon, will be imprisoned in the bottomless pit of fire, leaving the monks who worship Vile free to spread their dominion over the lands of men.'\n\nAt the mention of Yaemon's name there is uproar but as Glaivas continues an unnatural quiet descends.\n\n'Yaemon is preparing to set out even now from the city of Doomover on the long journey to the Ice Wastes. Though a Ranger long used to patrolling the wilderness on the edge of the Rift, I am no match for such as he. Is there one among you who will try to stop him?'\n\nAs Glaivas spoke you felt the burning need to be revenged on Yaemon flare within your breast. Your dream of Glaivas, for it was he you saw astride the deck of the ship which now rides at anchor near the sands, has convinced you that you are destined for this quest and you step forward saying, 'I  shall stop him.'\n\n'You are young,' says Glaivas, 'Can you succeed where I, a Ranger Lord, would fail?'\n\n'I am Ninja,' you reply.\n\nGlaivas starts. The Grandmaster of the Dawn sighs and says, 'Yes, I rename you Avenger, for if anyone can succeed, and you must for the sake of all mankind, it will be you.' With that he turns towards the Temple, and prayer.\n\nThe city of Doomover lies on the western coast of the Manmarch and Glaivas gifts you a map which shows the many cities and strange lands which stretch north to the snow wastes. You spend the rest of the day preparing, lacing the iron sleeves to your dark hued costume and gathering together the tools of the Ninja, before spending some hours in quiet meditation. You board Glaivas' ship in time to sail on the evening tide. You must find Yaemon and kill him before he reaches the Pillars of Change or all will be lost.",

Another priest casts a spell, the horse rears backwards and then two other horsemen wearing the same coat of arms, a silver sword hanging by a silver thread on a black background, ride up and take the reins from their friend.

The sea is so calm that after two weeks without the tang of salt spray on your lips you forget that it is composed of water at all. The oarsmen row for ten hours a day but they are free men, not chained to their oars. Two bear the scars of a pirate's persuader; captured by buccaneers, they are of the lucky few who have lived to see the sky again. All of them have the heavy upper body of the oarsman, some who turned to the sea for their livelihood too young are squat and mis-shapen, moulded by life at the oar into grotesque travesties of the mountain dwarves.\n\nThe Land of Plenty passes to the south and you are in sight of the Isle of the Magical Goddess when the lookout cries a warning. The helmsman steers a new course and the drum-beat quickens as the oarsmen redouble their efforts. The ship that is approaching is long and low, painted green and red and flying a red pennant at the top of its mast. Glaivas, standing next to you at the rail, says, 'That ship is from Port o' Reavers, weâ€™ll never outrun it.' So saying, he draws his sword.\n\nThe oarsmen strain, sweating with effort but they cannot match the pace of the slaves on the Reavers' ship, galvanized into a frenzied spurt by the barbed whips of their overseers. At last the Captain gives the order 'Prepare to repel boarders', and you ready yourself for combat. The pirate ship carries a spiked ram but they are obviously trying to take the Aquamarin as a prize for they grapple and come alongside. The Reavers carry scimitars and chain nets and are led in their rush to attack by a nine-foot monster whose body is covered in knobbles of mis-grown bone, an Ogre with a large spiked hammer. The Aquamarin's crew look no match for the battle-scarred buccaneers.",

You gain the roof and descend into a very small courtyard. Turning a corner of the courtyard wall, you are faced with a dead end.

There are forty or so drinkers, all men and mostly soldiers. There is not a single sailor to be seen even though you are still close to the harbour. The soldiers have brought their weapons into the tavern but many have loosened or discarded parts of their armour in the sweltering heat. The reek of stale sweat is overpowering. A man who must weigh twenty stones or more ambles up and down the long bar, slamming mugs of mead on the counter and pocketing silver.\n\nYou buy a mugful and listen to the conversations. They are shouting from table to table about the campaign they are going to fight against the people of the Spires of Foreshadowing. At one table a man of twenty-five or so is particularly loud. He demands mead and two of the soldiers with him grab his mug, fighting for the privilege of buying his drink. He ignores this and, spotting you, challenges you to a drinking bout.",

# ABOUT

This project was a means for myself to learn JavaScript and AngularJS to implement an interesting
project, namely an old-school choose-your-own-adventure book from my childhood. I found this book
on the shelf in a holiday house around the age of twelve, and proceeded to read it to destruction.
I knew the result of every choice by heart, and probably played it through a hundred times. I hit
on the idea of converting the story to an interactive web application while hunting for an idea to
learn AngularJS in greater detail.

# COPYRIGHT

This project is based upon a copyrighted work called [Avenger](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1029651.Avenger_)
to which I make no assertion of ownership. The authors
are [Mark Smith](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40911.Mark_Smith) and Jamie Thompson. While
the software portions of the project were written by myself, the setting, fiction and illustrations
are intellectual property of their respective copyright
holders. I have duplicated these elements as part of the project on the basis that the book is
relatively obscure and long out of print. This is obviously a complete infringement of copyright,
however I'm hoping that the copyright holder(s) will forgive me on the following basis:

1. This project is entirely noncommercial in nature;
2. I haven't advertised or promoted it anywhere;
3. It was created with the intent of preserving this work for future audiences
4. It was undertaken as a learning activity.

Doesn't really count as "fair use", but hope springs eternal eh?

The copyright holder needs only to send a request to <ashley@ropable.com>, and I will remove the
application and project from public view.

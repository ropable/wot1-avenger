# ABOUT

This project was a means for myself to learn JavaScript and AngularJS to implement an interesting
project, namely an old-school choose-your-own-adventure book from my childhood. I found this book
on the shelf in a holiday house around the age of twelve, and proceeded to read it to destruction.
I knew the result of every choice by heart, and probably played it through a hundred times. I hit
on the idea of converting the story to an interactive web application while hunting for an idea to
learn AngularJS in greater detail.

# COPYRIGHT

This project is based upon a copyrighted work to which I make no assertion of ownership. The author
is [NAME](URL) and the illustrator is [NAME](URL). While the software portions of the project were written by
myself, the setting, fiction and illustrations are intellectual property of their respective copyright
holders. I have duplicated these elements as part of the project on the basis that the book is
relatively obscure and long out of print. This project is also entirely noncommercial in nature,
with the intent of preserving this work for future audiences as well as being a learning activity.

The copyright holder needs only to send a request to <ashley@ropable.com>, and I will remove the
application and project from public view.
